          Greetings! I&rsquo;m Habib Behdarvandi, a seasoned specialist in
          JavaScript and TypeScript. My passion lies in crafting digital
          solutions that transcend boundaries. <br /> Currently, I&rsquo;m on
          the academic path, pursuing a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Professional
          Computer Engineering at Amirkabir Arak Technical and Vocational
          University. ðŸŽ“
          <br /> My extensive expertise covers a spectrum of technologies,
          including React, Redux, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI,
          TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, MongoDB, Prisma, and more. I continually
          expand my knowledge and skills in this ever-evolving digital
          landscape. ðŸš€
          <br /> I&rsquo;m not just a developer; I&rsquo;m a problem solver. I
          thrive on deciphering complex challenges and architecting elegant
          solutions to overcome them. When not immersed in code, you can find me
          in the Call of Duty: Warzone lobby. ðŸ‘»
          <br />
          <br /> I channel my creativity into app design using Figma, sculpting
          user-friendly interfaces. â˜• Amidst the hustle and bustle, I pause for
          a cup of coffee, savoring the moment with the symphony of my favorite
          music. I firmly believe that inspiration is often born from the rhythm
          of life. ðŸ‘¥
          <br />
          <br /> As a devoted team player, I thrive in collaborative
          environments. My ardor for leadership has led me to the role of a team
          manager on numerous occasions, steering projects towards triumphant
          success. Let&rsquo;s connect and embark on a journey of creation,
          innovation, and problem-solving! ðŸŒŸ
